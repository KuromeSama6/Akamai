# Akaimai
A modern implementation of ALL.Net protocols and services using Spring Boot and MongoDB.

Akamai aims to fully emulate the arcade experience, handling player accounts in a way that are only dependant on AIME cards.

Akamai is in its early development stages. Right now, Akamai is only being tested on Maimai DX (SDGA 1.45).
